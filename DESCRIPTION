Description: This package is useful for construction of selection index. 
 This package uses the mixed and random model least squares analysis to estimate the heritabilities of
 the traits and genetic correlation between the traits.This uses the sire model as it is considered as 
 random effect. The genetic and phenotypic (co)variances along with the relative economic values are 
 used to construct the selection index for any number of traits. It also estimates the accuracy of the
 index and the genetic gain expected for different traits.
